3 kinds of cuboids:
- nonshapeshifting: layers must be EXACTLY the same number to interchange
- internally bandaged:
    - centers extend inward.
    - naturally defined by cutting just the layers you asked for.
    - every layer (except outermost) is the same thickness from the origin.
- unbandaged:
    - centers are shallow.
    - naturally defined by cutting a big cube and bandaging pieces externally.
- equal divisions (of a cube?)


3x3x5 = 3x3 square x 3-layer line
