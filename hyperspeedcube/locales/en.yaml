    # Custom piece styles

    Custom styles can be applied to pieces using the **piece filters** tool.

  color_assignments_drag_reassign: Drag a facet name to assign a different color to it.
  color_assignments: |
    # Color assignments

    Each facet on the puzzle is assigned a different color.

    %{dragging}

    In addition to the color scheme settings, you can **%{color_reassign_mousebind}** a sticker to change its color assignment.

    - Single colors are best for small puzzles
    - Color sets are best for medium puzzles
    - Gradients are best for large puzzles
    - Colors within a color set are designed to contrast with each other and with other color sets of the same size

    Color values can be customized in the **global color palette** settings.

  global_color_palette: |
    # Global color palette

    The global color palette provides a way to change colors across all puzzles at once.

    For example, you can select a particular shade of red to use on every puzzle with red stickers.

    ## Color sets

    Some colors are organized into sets of colors that are similar but still contrast with each other.

    For example, a puzzle with two different shades of red needs those shades to be distinguishable, so it uses the "red dyad" from the global color palette.

    ## Color schemes

    The color scheme for any particular puzzle can be customized in the **color scheme** settings.

    # Presets

    A **preset** is a saved set of values that can be loaded at any time.

    - **Click** the `+` button to create a preset
    - **Click** a preset to activate it
    - **Right-click** a preset to rename or delete it
    - **Drag** a preset to reorder it

    Loading a preset discards unsaved changes.
