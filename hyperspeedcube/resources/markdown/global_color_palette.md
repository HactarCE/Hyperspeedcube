# Global color palette

The global color palette provides a way to change colors across all puzzles at once. For example, you can select a particular shade of red to use on every puzzle with red stickers.

Some colors are organized into sets of colors that are similar but still contrast with each other. For example, a puzzle with two different shades of red needs those shades to be distinguishable, so it uses the "red dyad" from the global color palette.

The color scheme for any particular puzzle can be customized in the **color scheme** settings.
