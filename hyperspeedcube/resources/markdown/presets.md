# Presets

A **preset** is a saved set of values that can be loaded at any time.

- **Click** on the `+` button to create a preset
- **Click** on a preset to activate it
- **Right-click** on a preset to rename or delete it
- **Drag** a preset to reorder it

Loading a preset discards unsaved changes.
