- are shape and cut both flat?
  - if yes, test all points and return combined result
  - if no, split shape manifold by cut
    - if all inside or all outside, return
    - if split, test all boundary elements
      - if on both sides, shape is split
      - if all on one side, test arbitrary point on other side
        - if point is outside shape, then shape is on one side
        - if point is inside shape, then shape is split
      - if all flush, test arbitrary point on each side
        - return results of point pair
