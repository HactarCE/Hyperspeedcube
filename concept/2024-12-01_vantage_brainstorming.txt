1. convert move into rotation
2. tuples of a few axes
- specify rotations for keybinds




camera orientation (floating-point yikes)
axis map
representative object of the symmetry
symmetry (based on puzzle definition?)


Vantage
- camera orientation (floating-point yikes)
- axis map
- representative object of the symmetry
- (expanded by symmetry of puzzle axes)




individual vantage is defined by set name + first few axes



VIEW ANGLE = list[linear combination of axis vectors -> point toward some vector]
