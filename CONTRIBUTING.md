# License & contributing

Hyperspeedcube is the product of the majority of my (Andrew Farkas's) free time over the course of many years. I'd like to retain some control over it, while still allowing it to benefit the open-source community. For that reason:

- The `hypermath` and `hypershape` crates are licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/license/mit) OR [Apache v2.0](https://apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
- The `hyperpuzzle`, `hyperprefs`, `hyperdraw`, `hyperpuzzleview`, and `hyperspeedcube` crates are licensed under [GNU GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) or later.

**By contributing to the [HactarCE Hyperspeedcube repository](https://github.com/HactarCE/Hyperspeedcube), you agree that your contributions will be under the sole ownership of Andrew Farkas.** I (Andrew Farkas) retain the sole right to release modifications of Hyperspeedcube under licenses other than GNU GPL.

For example, I may create a closed-source modification of Hyperspeedcube and monetize it (e.g., a VR version or mobile app). GNU GPL is irrevocable, so the version of the source code that you see here will always be available under the terms of GNU GPL.

If you want to use all or part of the source code for Hyperspeedcube for a purpose that is forbidden by this license, contact me and we may be able to work something out.
