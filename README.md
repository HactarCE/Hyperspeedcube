Hyperspeedcube is the product of the majority of my free time over the course of many years. I provide it free of charge to the Hypercubing community because I want puzzles to be accessible. If you want to make something using it, especially if you wish to monetize it, please contact me at <hello@ajfarkas.dev>. I legally cannot stop you from selling a derivative work using Hyperspeedcube, but it would be rude not to ask me first.
