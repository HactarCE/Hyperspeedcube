[ ] internal surfaces       (IS)
<----> facet shrink         (FS)
<----> sticker shrink       (SS)
<----> piece explode        (PE)

FS conflicts with IS
- when IS is checked, set FS to zero
- when FS is set to nonzero, uncheck IS

ALTERNATIVELY:
- gray out FS when IS is checked


1. apply SS if nonzero
2. apply FS if nonzero
3. apply PE if nonzero
4. apply piece transform
5. apply puzzle transform
